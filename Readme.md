# CleanWater Initiative

## Project Description

The CleanWater Initiative is a blockchain-based platform built on the Stacks network that enables global funding of water projects through community-driven verification and maintenance tracking. Our smart contract facilitates transparent funding mechanisms where individuals and organizations can contribute STX tokens to support clean water projects worldwide. The platform ensures accountability through community verification systems and tracks ongoing maintenance funds to ensure long-term sustainability of water infrastructure projects.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem that addresses the global water crisis by:

- **Democratizing Water Project Funding**: Enabling anyone, anywhere to contribute to clean water initiatives globally
- **Ensuring Transparency**: Providing full visibility into funding allocation, project progress, and maintenance activities
- **Community Verification**: Empowering local communities to verify project completion and ongoing maintenance
- **Sustainable Infrastructure**: Creating a maintenance fund system to ensure long-term operation of water projects
- **Global Impact**: Bridging the gap between donors worldwide and communities in need of clean water access

We believe that by leveraging blockchain technology, we can create a more efficient, transparent, and impactful approach to addressing water scarcity and quality issues globally.

## Future Scope
